# Traffic Simulator in Rust

## Overview

A comprehensive traffic simulation system built in Rust, modeling vehicle movement, road networks, and traffic dynamics.

## Features

- Multiple vehicle types (Car, Truck, Motorcycle, Bus)
- Road network with intersections
- Traffic signals and speed limits
- Vehicle movement simulation
- Basic traffic metrics calculation

## Project Structure

- `src/models/`: Core data models
- `src/simulation/`: Network and traffic simulation logic
- `src/metrics/`: Traffic performance tracking

## Requirements

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo package manager

## Running the Simulation

```bash
cargo run
```

## Future Improvements

- Advanced collision detection
- More complex traffic light logic
- Detailed congestion modeling
- Accident simulation
